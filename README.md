# HF CSV
HF CSV is a simple csv utility written in C. It allows you to create, read, edit, and save csv files. Not supposed to be anything serious, more of a fun project.

# Usage
To use the library, include hf_csv.h and compile hf_csv.c with your other source files or link it as a library.

# TODO:
- Complete Usage section of readme
- Rewrite documentation comments to contemplate custom allocator changes
