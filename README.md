# HF CSV
HF CSV is a simple csv utility written in C. It allows you to create, read, edit, and save csv files. Not supposed to be anything serious, more of a fun project.

# Build
Built using CMake, tested with MingW. There's a simple test program, where the library itself is statically linked.

# TODO:
- Add Usage section to readme
